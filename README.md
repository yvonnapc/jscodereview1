## Description

JavaScript Modern JS Code Review: Github API App. This application serves as a platform for the user to fill a form with the username of a Github account. The request is made through the Github API and returns a list of all the repositories belonging to the inputted username. 

## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Go to this address in your browser to obtain an API key: ```https://github.com/```
2. Open Terminal and clone into this repository: ```https://github.com/yvonnapc/jscodereview1.git```
3. Paste your API key into the ```.env``` and ```html``` files
4. Within the project directory run:<br>
       ```$ npm init ```<br>
       ```$ npm install ```<br>
       ```$ bower init ```<br>
       ```$ bower install ```<br>
       ```$ gulp build ```<br>
       ```$ gulp serve ```<br>
5. Your browser will automatically navigate to the app

## Known Bugs

Any consecutive form submissions are appended underneath the prior results as opposed to replacing them causing the browser page to be longer than it needs to be. The app will be more efficient and more visually engaging when this bug is fixed.
